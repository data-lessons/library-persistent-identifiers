## Materials for Library Carpentry development

These materials are based on the **Library Carpentry** materials initially developed and taught by [Dr James Baker](https://github.com/drjwbaker) and [Owen Stephens](https://github.com/ostephens) in the UK.
[http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/](http://librarycarpentry.github.io/outline/). The original Library Carpentry contained four modules:
- Introduction, including jargon busting, data structures and regular expressions
- The Unix shell, including use of the command line and commands such as`grep` and `sed` to find data within files
- Git and version control
- Using OpenRefine for data clean up.

These existing four repositories have been forked (links are below) and are being re-developed within individual repositories, with the addition of a fifth module that introduces **SQL**, a topic which many librarians have expressed interest in learning.

- [library-shell](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-shell)
- [library-git](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-git)
- [library-openrefine](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-openrefine)
- [library-sql](https://github.com/data-lessons/library-sql)

## The Sprint
 The aim of the sprint project is to extend Library Carpentry by 
 - adding new exercises to challenge participants
 - adding new multiple choice questions to test understanding
 - adding an SQL module
 - adding new databases, e.g. from digital humanities or elsewhere, so that the material can be used in training beyond the library community. 

## Participants
Anyone with an interest in the material is welcome to take part in the sprint. The project is being co-ordinated for the sprint by [Belinda Weaver](https://github.com/weaverbel) in Brisbane, who is hosting [a local site for participants](http://pad.software-carpentry.org/bris-sprint). People are welcome to sign on to the project there.
